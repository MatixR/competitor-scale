# Literature Review {#sec:litReview}

Fund investment behavior has previously been studied in the context of decreasing returns to own scale. @pw08 investigate the fund response to inflows. They find that funds diversify in response to new flows, especially if they operate in relatively illiquid markets. However, the extent of diversification is small compared to the tendency to mechanically scale up existing holdings. @pst17L develop and test a model of decreasing returns to scale in which size, turnover, portfolio liquidity, and fund expense ratios are determined jointly in equilibrium. They show that in the cross-section, larger funds tend to trade less, cost less, and hold more liquid portfolios, all of which is consistent with decreasing returns to own scale. However, no paper to date has examined the impact of competition on fund behavior.

The existing literature has provided evidence of a negative relation between fund performance and competition. @ww11 find that entry by similar funds is associated with decreased flows, performance, and increased exit for incumbents.
@pst15 perform a within-fund analysis showing a negative relationship between performance and aggregate industry scale. 
@hkp17 use holdings-based estimates of fund similarity to measure the number of competing funds, finding that the number of similar funds is negatively related to both the level and the persistence of performance in the cross-section. My primary contribution to this literature is to improve identification by analyzing evidence from a natural experiment provided by the 2003 mutual fund scandal. I also provide additional observational evidence that fund performance is decreasing in competitor scale, especially for funds pursuing less liquid strategies.

My investigation of fund behavior is informed by models of decreasing returns to scale by @bg04 and @pst17L.^[Models of decreasing returns to scale rely on the assumption that trading costs increase in the size of trades, especially in illiquid securities. @bcjt17 provide empirical evidence of such characteristics in mutual fund trading costs. Decreasing returns to scale are rooted in the price impact of mutual fund trades. Papers presenting evidence on price pressure due to mutual fund actions include @cs07, @kks12, @lou12, @ap14 and @blocher16.] Interpreting mutual funds as firms experiencing decreasing returns to scale in individual investments, my study is related to neoclassical models of multi-industry firms such as @mp02.

The preponderance of existing empirical evidence examining fund performance supports fund level decreasing returns to scale, despite mixed findings. @chhk04 document decreasing returns to scale using cross-sectional regressions. @rz15 exploit inflows following discrete Morningstar ratings changes to study the size-performance relation in a regression discontinuity framework, finding little evidence of decreasing returns to scale. @pst15 find a negative within-fund association between fund size and performance, but the economic magnitude of the effect is small, and the coefficients statistically insignificant when using bias-free estimation methods. @mclemore16 studies returns following fund mergers, finding that the increased size of the acquiring fund is accompanied by decreased performance. In contemporaneous work, @hl17 use a random effects model and estimate economically significant decreasing returns to own scale. 

In a broad sense, I contribute to a long line of inquiry into the the nature of skill and constraints among active funds. The typical active fund fails to generate risk-adjusted returns [@jensen68; @malkiel95; @malkiel13; @gruber96; @french08; @ff10]. It would appear at first glance that skill is in short supply among active funds, a puzzle given the vast resources they manage. However, concurrent poor performance and large size is consistent with a combination of skill and decreasing returns to scale [@bg04; @ps12]. My analysis gives additional credence to the existence of economically important constraints in active management due to decreasing returns to scale. The empirical results I present are consistent with optimizing behavior by portfolio managers in the face of evolving constraints in imperfect capital markets.

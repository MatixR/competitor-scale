# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

Studying the allocation of capital inside firms is complicated by the difficulty of observation. Mutual funds are required to report their holdings, allowing the researcher to sidestep this issue. I provide novel evidence on the impact of competition on the capital allocation inside active mutual funds. I find that funds decrease allocation to costly active strategies in response to increased competition. I interpret this finding through the lens of existing models as evidence of information asymmetry between fund managers and outside investors. 

While I argue that the evidence is consistent with managers possessing superior information about the fund's prospects relative to investors, modeling the incentive effects of this asymmetry is beyond the scope of this paper. One might expect instances of moral hazard to arise in this context. I leave an exploration of this issue to future research.

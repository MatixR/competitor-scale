I studied the impact of competition on the investment decisions of active mutual funds. While there is a growing literature concerned with the deleterious effect of competition on fund performance, the link between competition and fund behavior has remained unexamined until now. In line with previous research, my study suggests that competition for investment opportunities is an endogenous determinant of active investors' profitability. The equilibrium response to changes in investment opportunities depends on the evaluation of prospective fund profitability by both managers and outside investors. Therefore, studying fund behavior has the potential to provide a window into whether managers and outside investors make disparate assessments of fund prospects.

In order to provide empirical evidence, I studied the response of fund behavior to changes in the scale of competing funds. I found that funds decrease capital allocation to costly active strategies in response to increased competitor scale, which is consistent with fund managers being better informed about fund prospects than outside investors. To aid the causal interpretation of these findings, I exploited the 2003 mutual fund scandal as a quasi-exogenous shock to the size of funds tainted by the scandal. 

My study has provided suggestive evidence that competition, fund performance, behavior, and investor flows are connected through the profitability of investment opportunities available to funds, as well as agents' assessments of these opportunities. Future research might examine these connections explicitly in a unified theoretical and empirical framework.
